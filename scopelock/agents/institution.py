"""C3 (institution side) + C7 disclosure. English primary — the judge/rep dials this leg.

Layer 1 of the Mandate lives here structurally: FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS never get an
@institution.on_action(...) handler. There is no task, field, or code path that reaches
"agree to a payment plan" — a jailbreak cannot reach a task that does not exist.

ALLOWED_ACTIONS / FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS themselves live in core/mandate.py (not here) so that
importing them — e.g. from scopelock/api/server.py, for the console — never triggers
guava.Agent()'s network auth. See mandate.py's module docstring.

Neither party has to stay on hold waiting for the other to dial in. She calls in once to
do intake and confirm the mandate, then hangs up — see agents/household.py. The moment the
representative calls this leg, on_call_start places an outbound callback to her real
number (captured from caller ID at intake) so she's live again before the case proceeds.
